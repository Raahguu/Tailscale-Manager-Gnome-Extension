# Tailscale Manager Gnome Extension
A small extension to manage tailscale through a small GUI on the desktop rather then through the CLI

## Disclaimer
This project/extension is in no way affiliated with Tailscale Inc. 

## Current Capabilities
I want this project to be able to do four simple things:
1. Turn tailscale on and off
2. Allow the user to easily copy the IP of a remote node
3. Change which exit node the current node is using

## Dependencies
You need tailscale already logged in, and you need to be running GNOME.
But if you got this far you probably knew that
